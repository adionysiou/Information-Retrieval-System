8,US,"This re-named vineyard was formerly bottled as deLancellotti. You'll find striking minerality underscoring chunky black fruits. Accents of citrus and graphite comingle, with exceptional midpalate concentration. This is a wine to cellar, though it is already quite enjoyable. Drink now through 2030.",Silice,95,65.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Bergstr√∂m
