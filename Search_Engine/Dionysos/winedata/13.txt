13,France,This wine is in peak condition. The tannins and the secondary flavors dominate this ripe leather-textured wine. The fruit is all there as well: dried berries and hints of black-plum skins. It is a major wine right at the point of drinking with both the mature flavors and the fruit in the right balance.,Ch√¢teau Montus Prestige,95,90.0,Southwest France,Madiran,,Tannat,Vignobles Brumont
