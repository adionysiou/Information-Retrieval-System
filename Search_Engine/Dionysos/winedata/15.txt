15,US,"First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028.",Sigrid,95,90.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Bergstr√∂m
