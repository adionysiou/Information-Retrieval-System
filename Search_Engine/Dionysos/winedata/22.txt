22,Spain,"Tarry blackberry and cheesy oak aromas are appropriate for a wine of this size and magnitude. In the mouth, this Tinta de Toro is expansive and grabby, with bullish tannins. Slightly salty earthy accents come with core blackberry flavors and notes of baking spices and chocolate, while on the finish this is long, chocolaty, delicious and not too hard or tannic.
